# Exercise 8-7

> `malloc` accepts a size request without checking its plausability; `free` belives that the block it is asked to free contains a valid `size` field.
> Improve these routines so they take more pains with error checking. 

## Process
I found this exercise hard to grasp so I ended up following the excellent explanation from a CLC Wiki solution which I've basically copied here.

Also, I wanted to try testing tools for this exercise, but _AddressSanitizer_, _Valgrind_, and the fuzzers I found donâ€™t work on Windows.

### Confusion

I didn't quite understand what `plausability` and `valid` meant in this context. 

I think part of what threw me off was how the program relies on the user to return correct addresses instead of tracking allocated blocks. 
I'd have used a separate linked list of allocated blocks, but maybe it's better to avoid unnecessary references and logic, I guess I'm not used to thinking of a program in this way

Initially, I thought the exercise involved fixing memory corruption of the allocated blocks, but that seems out of scope because there would be many other problems to take care of.

I knew that the exercise wasn't about fixing an invalid value passed to `unsigned nbytes` and `unsigned size`, because they would just overflow:

```
C89/C90 Specification
6.1.2.5 - Types
Computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result 
that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced 
modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value
```

## Other Solutions - [CLC-Wiki](https://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K%26R2_solutions:Chapter_8:Exercise_7)
The anonymous answer here was amazing. I've basically just copied their answer.

I now realise the exercise is about handling incorrect user input to the functions and what happens at the variable size limits.

The main issues, as I understand, are:
- `malloc(0)` creates a Header only block of size 1 and returns a pointer to invalid memory
- `malloc(UINT_MAX)` creates a memory allocation too big to also include the Header
- `free(NULL)` causes segmentation fault when trying to dereference allocation
- `free(*ptr)` where `*ptr` has size 0, it has to be an incorrect allocation, due to first issue
- `free(*ptr)` trying to join two large blocks, could create a block with size so big it overflows the `unsigned size` field

So the fixes would be:
- `malloc`: check `nbytes` isn't 0 
- `malloc`: check max allocation is `< UINT_MAX - sizeof(Header)`
- `free`: check `*ptr` isn't `NULL`
- `free`: check `*ptr` size isn't 0
- `free`: check that merged blocks size won't become `> UINT_MAX` before merging

## Other Solutions - C Answer Book
It suggests two things:
- create an _'arbitrary constant MAXBYTES'_ _'...that works best for your system.'_
- create a _'static variable maxalloc that remembers the size of the largest block used so far'_ to check when freeing

Doesn't explain how to determine MAXBYTES, not sure I like this as a solution.

Also, I feel like there could be a more robust solution than just remembering the largest block. 

Personally I feel like keeping a list of allocated blocks, so you can return it to freelist would be slower, but less errors?

## Code - changes to `malloc`
```c
/* check nbytes isn't 0 */
if (nbytes == 0) {
  printf("Failed to allocate 0 bytes");
  return NULL;
}

/* check max allocation is < UINT_MAX - sizeof(Header) */
if (nbytes > (UINT_MAX - sizeof(Header))) {
  printf("Failed to allocate UINT_MAX - sizeof(Header) bytes");
  return NULL;
}
```

## Code - changes to `free`
```c
/* check ptr isn't NULL */
if (ap == NULL) {
  printf("Failed to free NULL");
  return;
}

/* check ptr size isn't 0 */
if (bp->s.size == 0) {
  printf("Failed to free allocated block of size 0");
  return;

/* check that merged blocks size won't become > UINT_MAX before merging */
if ((bp + bp->s.size == p->s.ptr) && ((bp->s.size + p->s.ptr->s.size) < UINT_MAX)) {
  /* upper join code */
}
if ((p + p->s.size == bp) && ((bp->s.size + p->s.size) < UINT_MAX)) {
  /* lower join code */
}
```
